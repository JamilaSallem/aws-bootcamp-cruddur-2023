During this week, I watched all the playlist videos for the Free AWS Project Bootcamp - Week 0.

I also created the logical diagram for the cruddur application on Lucidchart using different aws services.

When it comes to cost management, I created a billing alarm under CloudWatch

In addition to this, I added MFA to my AWS root account and then created a user and added to an Admin user group

I added a MFA device to my new IAM user and then created the access keys
